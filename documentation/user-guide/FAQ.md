# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is a 3D model?

3D models are computerized representations of three dimensional objects. These models are typically made up of a large collection of connected points and shapes which create the outer surface of the object. 3D models are used in a variety of fields such as medicine, engineering, film, and video games. 3D models come in a variety of formats, although our platform currently only supports .gltf, .stl, .fbx, .ply, .obj, and .usdz.

## Should I create an account?

Our home page is available to the public no matter if you have an account with us or not! This means anyone can view and interact with public models uploaded by our users. However, our best features including uploading, storing, and downloading models are only available to users with registered accounts.

## Where is my model stored?

Our platform leverages Microsoft Azureâ€™s Blob storage to provide fast and secure upload, long term storage, and download of models. All uploaded models are safe behind robust authentication and encryption in the cloud.

## What do the model privacy settings mean?

Glimpse has three primary privacy options for any given model:

  - **Private** means that only the owner can view and/or download the model.
  - **Publicly Accessible** means that any user (even those not logged in) can view the model, but the owner is still the only one who can download it. It may also appear on the home page.
  - **Publicly Usable** means that any user can view and download the model. It may also appear on the home page.
